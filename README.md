# A-Journey-To-The-Center-Of-The-Node
NOTE: This series is still a WIP and more detail will be added to each chapter. Also, some information needs to be updated/added for post merge Ethereum nodes as some of the content was written pre-merge. This note will be removed when the book is finished.

To many, blockchain node clients are a black box. Even some experienced developers who have written smart contracts or off-chain logic, might not know what is happening under the hood when they send an RPC request to a node client. 

If someone were to ask you, "When you broadcast a transaction to the network, what happens between sending the transaction to the node and when the transaction is finally included in a published block?", how detailed would your answer be? Through reading this series, you will be able to describe the innerworking of a node in detail, as well as how the node can be potentially optimized for your usecase. By the end of the series, you will be able to explain how nodes work at deeply intuitive level, where you could explain each part of a node to another blockchain developer, someone new to coding, or even your non-technical peers.

This series will explore node clients for a variety of networks including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Solana and more. This series will also take a deep dive into each client's codebase and while it is not integral to know Rust/Go, it will greatly help you in understanding how the node works under the hood.


For this series to be a comfortable read, you should be familiar with [how blockchains work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QphJEO9ZX6s). At the beginning of each major section that starts to explore a new node client, there will be resources to help you get familiar with how the chain works before jumping deeply into the node.

As a final note before starting the series, it is helpful to know that each chapter builds upon the last. The first chapters are a quick and easy introduction into a chain, with the final chapters exploring complex topics at a very low level. With this in mind, the most effective way to read this series is in sequential order, without skipping chapters.


With all of that out of the way, enjoy the series and feel free to send me any questions [@0xKitsune on Twitter](https://twitter.com/home).
